     <h3>Public Observatory</h3>
     About our Telescopes
Our largest telescope is a 16-inch Boller & Chivens telescope, purchased in 1967 by Harvard College Observatory. 
 It is named the Cook Memorial Telescope in memory of Chester Sheldon Cook, a long-time member of the Amateur Telescope
  Makers of Boston. The telescope was used by generations of students at the Harvard-Smithsonian Oak Ridge Observatory
   in Harvard, Massachusetts. The Cook Memorial Telescope was loaned, and later donated by Harvard, to the Museum as the
    primary telescope in the Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory.

Our favorite objects to observe with the Cook Memorial Telescope are planets and double stars.
